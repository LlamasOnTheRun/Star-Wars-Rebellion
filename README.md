Gonna see if the repository changes

### Things needing to be complete
#### Backend
- Connection to localhost frontend to backend
- Making a database for the data instead of sql sheets
  - AWS database maybe RDS
  - Will require cleanup with H2 database
#### Frontend
- Fix lines between planets
  - Need to connect to other Div sections (Will require Math)
  - Will need to style them to make it look cooler
- Will need make "Region" components for planets to group them up effetivly
  - This may introduce a challenge with the lines maybe
